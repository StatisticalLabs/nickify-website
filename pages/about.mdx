# About

Nickify was originally an idea from [GNZGUY](https://youtube.com/@GNZGUY) who wanted a simple way to add their subscriber count to their Discord nickname.

Thanks to the community, the bot has grown quickly and has become the go-to way to add subscriber counts to nicknames, and has [joined Statistical Labs as May 3rd, 2023](https://statistical.vercel.app/blog/nickify-joins-statistical)!
