### Add Nickify to your server

import Image from "next/image";

This step is only for admins who have `Manage Guild` and don't already have Nickify in their server.

Go to [this link](/invite) in your browser. You should see a page like this:

<Image
  src="/docs/invite_example.png"
  alt="Invite Example"
  width={400}
  height={545}
/>

Select your server with the dropdown. Then click `Continue`.

You should then see a page like this:

<Image
  src="/docs/authorize_example.png"
  alt="Authorize Example"
  width={400}
  height={582}
/>

Click `Authorize`. You should then see a confirmation page like this:

<Image
  src="/docs/authorized_example.png"
  alt="Authorized Example"
  width={400}
  height={545}
/>

This means you've added Nickify to your server. Great job!

### Use the command

To setup Nickify, you can run `/set channel`. Search for your channel, or input your channel's ID or handle.

### Done!

You should then see a message like this:

<Image
  src="/docs/successful_setup_example.png"
  alt="Successful Setup Example"
  width={400}
  height={185}
/>

This means you've set it up correctly. Congratulations!

</Steps>
