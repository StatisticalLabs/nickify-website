# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why does it send an error when I try to set my channel?

### Server owner

For now, Nickify cannot change the nicknames of server owners due to Discord not allowing any members to update the owner (change nickname, ban, kick, etc.).

### Normal member

This means that Nickify's role is below your role. Ask an admin to move Nickify's role above all member roles to allow it to modify member's nicknames.

Also make sure to tell them to give Nickify the `Manage Nicknames` permission, as this is important for the bot to change member's nicknames.

## Why is it not updating my nickname?

If Nickify hasn't updated your nickname in a while, try running the command from [the Getting Started page](/docs/getting-started) again.

If that still doesn't work, contact us on [Discord](/discord).
